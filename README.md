#### Some Notes:
- I've added SASS / SCSS to this project purely to keep the styling more readable / succinct
  - I can switch to CSS styling if preferred upon request
- I've also added a "bonus" feature in order to show that more upvote groups could be added dynamically. 
  - This functionality was commented out in order to keep the project closer to spec. Feel free to uncomment the code in `App.vue` if you'd like to test it out! :)
